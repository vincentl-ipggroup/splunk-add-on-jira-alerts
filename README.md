# JIRA Alert Add-on

## Introduction

This add-on allows Splunk to create JIRA issues as an alert action.

This add-on was produced as part of the
[Developer Guidance](http://dev.splunk.com/goto/alerting) project. Read our
guide to learn more about creating custom actions that can be performed when an
alert triggers.

## Installation

Once the app is installed (through [Splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com),
`Install app from file`, or by copying this directory to the etc/apps/ directory
of your Splunk installation), go to the app management page in the Splunk
interface. Click `Set up` in the JIRA Ticket Creation row. Fill out the required
attributes for your JIRA installation and you are ready to go.

To add a JIRA action to an alert, go to the `Alerts` tab in the `Search` app and
find the alert for which you want to add JIRA tickets. Click `Edit`, and select
`Edit Actions`. Click `+ Add Actions` and select JIRA. Fill out the attributes
for the artifact you wish to create in JIRA when the associated search returns
results, and Splunk will start logging bugs for you.

NB: To Get the list of Jira Users, the user defined during the setup must have valid permission to access them.
